Sorty
=====

Sorty is a jQuery based tool to visually sort items into containers with some additional bells and whistles to make the whole process smoother and more intuitive.

I wrote this tool when I had to sort guests into rooms for our church retreat. Rather than trying to do the sorting by hand, which seemed like a really daunting task, I wanted to do it visually with an ability to export the assignment list to Excel and then merge into door signs.

This tool can also be used to assign guests to tables at the wedding reception. Or campers to cabins. Or whatever else that you need to sort.

Online version of the tool is hosted at http://www.nesbc.com/sorty/
